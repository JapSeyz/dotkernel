# Step 1: Creating a contact controller

We refer here to DotKernel controllers, which are middleware that can handle requests based on an action parameter. 
One method per action is used. Controllers help organize code by keeping related code together. 
We recommend you to check the documentation for [dot-controller](https://github.com/dotkernel/dot-controller)
