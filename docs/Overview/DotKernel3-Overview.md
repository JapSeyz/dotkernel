# DotKernel3 Overview
---

DotKernel is a collection of PSR-7 Middleware Applications, built on top of Zend Expressive microframework and is composed of a set of custom and extended Zend Framework components.

DotKernel3 consists of a suite of packages.

DotKernel3 is built for developers and should empower them to build great digital experiences easily. 
As a consequence DotKernel3 is NOT an "out-of-the-box" software product like Wordpress, Magento, Akeneo, WooCommerce, Shopify and others. 
You need a developer to get started.
